# Dice Roller App

A dynamic, interactive Dice Roller built with **vanilla JavaScript**.  
You can roll as many dice as you want, and each result is visualized with crisp dice images â€” just like the real thing

## Live Demo

- [Live Site]( https://michael-okorie.github.io/Dice-Roller/)  
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Michael-Okorie/Dice-Roller.git)

---

## Built With

- **HTML5** â€“ clean semantic structure  
- **CSS3** â€“ minimal styling (or go styled how you like)  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ full control of the DOM, loops, randomness  
- **No frameworks** â€“ raw code, real logic, no shortcuts

---

## Features

- Roll 1 or multiple dice at once  
- Dynamically display images based on the roll  
- Instant results, no page reloads  
- Logic written from scratch (no libraries or dependencies)

---

## What I Learned

This project helped me practice and solidify:
- DOM element targeting (`getElementById`)
- Dynamic loops and value generation
- Random number logic in JavaScript
- `innerHTML` vs `textContent`
- Using template literals for clean image insertion

---

## Code Highlight

```js
const value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
images.push(`<img src="./Dice-Image/${value}.png" alt="dice ${value}">`);
```
